## ABOUT

Having previously learned `C` and `C++`, I've always been intrigued by `Assembly`.

Here, I will upload my `x86 Assembly` files but, for a clearer and more organized view of my documentation progress, thoughts and references, check my project [documentation](https://jotavare.github.io/x86_assembly_nasm).

Another project I want to do after learning the basics of `Assembly` is to redo my [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft) and convert all functions from `C` to `x86 Assembly`, or at least try to. My progress will be available [here](https://github.com/jotavare/libft-x86-assembly).
