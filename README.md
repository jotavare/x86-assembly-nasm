## ABOUT

Having previously learned **C** and **C++**, I've always been intrigued by **Assembly** but never had the chance to fully explore it.

This repository serves as a personal project for uploading my **Assembly** files. For a clearer and more organized view of my documentation progress and references, you can visit my [website](https://jotavare.github.io/x86_assembly_nasm).

Another project I want to do after learning the basics of **Assembly** is to redo [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft) and convert all 43 functions in **C** to **Assembly**, or at least try to.
