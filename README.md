## ABOUT

Having previously learned `C` and `C++`, I've always been intrigued by `Assembly` but never had the chance to fully explore it.

This repository serves as a personal project for uploading my `Assembly` files. You can follow along with my document progress [here](https://jotavare.github.io/x86_assembly_nasm/).

Another project I want to do after learning the basics of `Assembly` is redoing [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft) and convert all 43 functions in `C` to `Assembly`, or at least try too.
